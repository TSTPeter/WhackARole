            <p>This game was built for the <b>TST Away Day 2024</b>.<br><br>
            It was designed to showcase the <b>volume of recruitment</b> we experienced to achieve our growth.<br>
            It also highlights how our HR approach at present is <b>time-intensive</b>.<br><br>
            Through this game, we ask the question "<b>How and where should we automate processes?</b>"<br><br>
            90% of the code and graphics for this game was generated by AI, without modification.<br>
            We demonstrate how quality of AI-generated content can be below our company standards<br>ie: the spelling in the profile cards.<br><br>
            Enjoy!</p>
